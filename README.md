# Song Genre Classification with Neural Network
This is the code for the project of Numerical Analysis for Machine Learning (NAML) at Politecnico di Milano.<br>
The goal of the project was to create an artificial neural network for music genre recognition; we used a 1D Residual Convolutional Neural Network with the GTZAN Music Genre
Dataset.<br>
We used Google Colab to program and train the Neural Network and we used python with Keras to create the model of the ANN.<br>
The project has been done in groups of two students
